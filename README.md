Gender equality is, first and foremost, a human right. A woman is entitled to live in
dignity and in freedom from acquiring what they want and what they aim to achieve
in their lives. Empowering women is additionally an essential tool for advancing
development and reducing poverty. Empowered women contribute to the health and
productivity of whole families and communities and to improved prospects for the
next generation. India’s female labor force participation rate is among the lowest in
the world and has declined significantly over the last two decades, according to data
from the International Labor Organization. This decline in Indian female labor force
participation, despite rising incomes, robust economic growth, falling fertility rates
and improvements in female literacy has been baffling. A new ICRIER study
suggests that the main root cause beneath this worrying trend is patriarchy. The
prevailing social norms and patriarchy hinders female participation in the economy
despite their increasingly higher levels of education. So basically, women get their
education and not being ‘allowed’ to work. Even the part of working women faces
many inequalities such as differences in wages when compared to men, while they
are expected to do the same or double the amount of work than men do. Hence, I
need to be part of this social change by Empowering women where their financial
independence plays a major role in improving and making their lives better.
